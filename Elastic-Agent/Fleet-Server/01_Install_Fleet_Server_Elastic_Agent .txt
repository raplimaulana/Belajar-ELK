### INSTALL STAND ALONE ELASTIC AGENT ###
Fleet Server is a component that connects Elastic Agents to Fleet. 
It supports many Elastic Agent connections and serves as a control plane for updating agent policies, collecting status information, and coordinating actions across Elastic Agents. 
It also provides a scalable architecture, As the size of your agent deployment grows, you can deploy additional Fleet Servers to manage the increased workload.

On-premises Fleet Server is not currently available for use in an Elastic Cloud Serverless environment. 
We recommend using the hosted Fleet Server that is included and configured automatically in Serverless Observability and Security projects.

##Flow Fleet Server on Elastic Agent 
The following diagram shows how Elastic Agents communicate with Fleet Server to retrieve agent policies:
1. When a new agent policy is created, the Fleet UI saves the policy to a Fleet index in Elasticsearch.
2. To enroll in the policy, Elastic Agents send a request to Fleet Server, using the enrollment key generated for authentication.
3. Fleet Server monitors Fleet indices, picks up the new agent policy from Elasticsearch, then ships the policy to all Elastic Agents enrolled in that policy. Fleet Server may also write updated policies to the Fleet index to manage coordination between agents.
4. Elastic Agent uses configuration information in the policy to collect and send data to Elasticsearch.
5. Elastic Agent checks in with Fleet Server for updates, maintaining an open connection.
6. When a policy is updated, Fleet Server retrieves the updated policy from Elasticsearch and sends it to the connected Elastic Agents.
7. To communicate with Fleet about the status of Elastic Agents and the policy rollout, Fleet Server writes updates to Fleet indices.
