### INSTALL STAND ALONE ELASTIC AGENT ###
Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to a host. 
It can also protect hosts from security threats, query data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and more. 
A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy monitoring across your infrastructure. 
Each agent has a single policy you can update to add integrations for new data sources, security protections, and more.

As the following diagram illustrates, Elastic Agent can monitor the host where itâ€™s deployed, and it can collect and forward data from remote services and hardware where direct deployment is not possible.
